## Metis Project 2 - Linear Regression

In this project, I use multivariate linear regression to try and predict the Total Gross Revenue for a motion picture using only data typically available before the movie is released. The data for this project includes information on 10,000 movies which were scraped from IMDB using [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). Additional data on oscar nominations was collected from wikipedia in an attempt to engineer additional features for the model. Modeling was done using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) with the best model utilizing Lasso Regression which achieved an R-squared value of approximately 0.48
